# Aptos/Move Integration Blockers and Challenges

This document outlines the key blockers and challenges encountered while integrating Aptos/Move into the Unite DeFi cross-chain swap protocol.

## 1. Structural Differences

### 1.1 Account Model vs UTXO
- **Challenge**: Move uses an account-based model with resources, unlike Ethereum's account model
- **Impact**: Escrow creation patterns need to be redesigned using resource accounts
- **Solution**: Implemented resource accounts for escrow isolation

### 1.2 No CREATE2 Equivalent
- **Challenge**: Move doesn't have deterministic address generation like Ethereum's CREATE2
- **Impact**: Cannot predict escrow addresses before deployment
- **Solution**: Use resource account pattern with seeds for pseudo-deterministic addresses

## 2. Language Limitations

### 2.1 Limited Cryptographic Primitives
- **Challenge**: Move has limited built-in hash functions (no keccak256)
- **Impact**: Cannot use same hash algorithms as Ethereum contracts
- **Solution**: Use SHA3-256 or other available hash functions, ensure compatibility layer

### 2.2 No Low-Level Assembly
- **Challenge**: Move doesn't support inline assembly or low-level operations
- **Impact**: Cannot implement certain optimizations available in Solidity
- **Solution**: Accept performance trade-offs, optimize at algorithm level

### 2.3 Strict Type System
- **Challenge**: Move's linear type system and resource safety
- **Impact**: More verbose code for resource management
- **Solution**: Embrace the safety guarantees, use proper resource patterns

## 3. Cross-Chain Interoperability

### 3.1 Different Transaction Models
- **Challenge**: Aptos uses different transaction structure and signing
- **Impact**: Cannot reuse Ethereum transaction patterns
- **Solution**: Implement Aptos-specific transaction builders and signers

### 3.2 Event System Differences
- **Challenge**: Move events work differently than Ethereum events
- **Impact**: Event monitoring and indexing requires different approach
- **Solution**: Use Aptos event streams and custom indexing

### 3.3 Time Handling
- **Challenge**: Aptos uses microseconds, Ethereum uses seconds
- **Impact**: Timestamp conversions needed for timelocks
- **Solution**: Consistent conversion layer in integration code

## 4. Testing Challenges

### 4.1 Limited Testing Framework
- **Challenge**: Move unit testing is less mature than Hardhat/Foundry
- **Impact**: More complex test setup and fewer utilities
- **Solution**: Build custom test helpers and utilities

### 4.2 No Local Fork Mode
- **Challenge**: Cannot fork mainnet for testing like Ethereum
- **Impact**: Cannot test against production state
- **Solution**: Use devnet/testnet or mock services

## 5. Deployment and Upgrades

### 5.1 No Proxy Pattern
- **Challenge**: Move modules are immutable once deployed
- **Impact**: Cannot upgrade contracts like in Ethereum
- **Solution**: Design with upgradeability in mind, use versioning

### 5.2 Different Gas Model
- **Challenge**: Aptos gas model differs from Ethereum
- **Impact**: Gas estimation and optimization strategies differ
- **Solution**: Implement Aptos-specific gas estimation

## 6. Specific Implementation Blockers

### 6.1 Merkle Tree Implementation
- **Challenge**: No built-in Merkle tree libraries in Move
- **Impact**: Multiple fills pattern more complex
- **Solution**: Implement custom Merkle tree or use simpler approach

### 6.2 Signature Verification
- **Challenge**: Different signature schemes (Ed25519 vs ECDSA)
- **Impact**: Cannot verify Ethereum signatures in Move
- **Solution**: Use chain-specific signature verification

### 6.3 Token Standards
- **Challenge**: Different token standards (Coin vs ERC20)
- **Impact**: Token handling logic needs abstraction
- **Solution**: Implement adapter pattern for token operations

## 7. Workarounds Implemented

1. **Resource Accounts**: Used for escrow isolation instead of CREATE2
2. **Event Streaming**: Custom event monitoring for cross-chain coordination
3. **Time Conversion**: Utility functions for microsecond/second conversion
4. **Mock Relayer**: Built testing infrastructure for cross-chain flows
5. **Type Adapters**: Created abstractions for cross-chain type compatibility

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Design First**: Account for Move's restrictions in initial design
2. **Embrace Safety**: Use Move's safety features rather than fighting them
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Compensate for tooling limitations with comprehensive tests
4. **Document Well**: Clear documentation of Move-specific patterns
5. **Version Carefully**: Plan for non-upgradeable deployments

## 9. Future Improvements

1. **Indexer Service**: Build robust event indexing for Aptos
2. **Gas Optimization**: Profile and optimize Move bytecode
3. **Testing Tools**: Contribute to Move testing ecosystem
4. **Cross-Chain Standards**: Propose standards for cross-chain protocols
5. **Security Audits**: Move-specific security considerations

## Conclusion

While Move presents certain challenges compared to Solidity, its safety guarantees and resource model provide benefits for cross-chain protocols. The key is designing with Move's paradigms in mind rather than trying to port Ethereum patterns directly.
