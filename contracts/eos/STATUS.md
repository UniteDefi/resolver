# EOS Contract Deployment Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Structure** - Created complete EOS project structure
2. **Contract Code** - Counter contract written in C++ with all actions
3. **TypeScript Testing** - Complete test suite with eosjs integration
4. **Environment Setup** - Real Jungle Testnet configuration with your keys
5. **Account Creation** - Main contract account `unitedefidep` created and funded
6. **Connection Testing** - Verified connection to Jungle Testnet works

## ⚠️ Next Steps Required

### 1. Compile Contract to WASM
The contract needs to be compiled with EOSIO CDT. Options:

**Option A: Install EOSIO CDT locally**
```bash
# Install EOSIO CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)
# Follow instructions at: https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt
```

**Option B: Use online compiler**
- Use EOSIO Studio or other online tools
- Compile the C++ files in `src/counter.cpp` and `include/counter.hpp`

**Option C: Use Docker**
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/project eosio/eosio.cdt:v1.8.1 \
  eosio-cpp -abigen -I/project/include -contract=counter \
  -o /project/build/counter.wasm /project/src/counter.cpp
```

### 2. Create Test User Accounts
Test accounts need to be created on Jungle Testnet:

**Account 1:**
- Name: `unitedefiusr1`
- Public Key: `EOS5mcbbkDTMV6vjhvc8q78XAwSg8HxjjSkwFk3WTPnrAEjxBKyx9`

**Account 2:**
- Name: `unitedefiusr2`
- Public Key: `EOS62nEFWSiu4nBQ4vJ4SB3Tg1g4suaJKBiSPYmZbQAp7UA1E44HK`

Create at: https://monitor4.jungletestnet.io/#account

### 3. Deploy Contract
Once you have the WASM file:
```bash
yarn deploy:testnet
```

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
yarn test
```
