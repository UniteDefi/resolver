# XRPL Cross-Chain HTLC Bridge

A comprehensive implementation of Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC) for atomic cross-chain swaps between EVM chains (like Base Sepolia) and XRPL.

## ðŸŒ‰ Overview

This project enables trustless cross-chain swaps using:
- **HTLC (Hash Time Locked Contracts)** for atomic swap security
- **Multi-resolver architecture** for decentralized liquidity provision
- **Partial fill support** for handling large orders
- **Safety deposits** to ensure resolver commitment
- **Timelock-based security** to prevent fund loss
