- **URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Status:** ✅ Operational
- **Health Check:** `{"status":"ok","chains":[84532, 421614, 11155111]}`

#### Resolver Services

- **Gasless Resolvers:** Attempted but need integration fixes

## Test Execution Details

### Test Scenario
User swaps 10 USDT (Base Sepolia) → DAI (Arbitrum Sepolia) using gasless transaction

### Participants
- **User:** `0xAf2804e7A36B096c56cd90284f9F7172a6F91AbC`
- **Resolver:** `0xF518baf01B2439878c454C713733ddd17e3d522e`

### Transaction Flow

1. **Pre-approval Phase**
   - User pre-approved USDT to escrow factory
   - No transaction recorded (already approved)

2. **Auction Creation**
   - **Auction ID:** `0x93684a13a05241b2cb303244aff7fa979bc5867cc1fc3678737128680684972f`
   - **Secret Hash:** `0x219c8fcade4a361798bbc61e0a4855e8ffaffd8e7e4ef7386db5ba33f7b889e4`
   - **Parameters:**
     - Amount: 10 USDT
     - Start Price: 11 DAI
     - End Price: 9 DAI
     - Duration: 300 seconds
   - **Signature:** `0x35112f337969f104143e3885040799d715fc3c30cfcf780847d0a0ff1d5b82916a07ade2039667337ca76faf4ab4a0e30fae19be2deaa429b8578c155690fea71b`

3. **Auction Status**
   - Status: Pending (no resolver commitment yet)
   - Current Price: 10.4874 DAI (calculated based on Dutch auction formula)

### Balances

| Participant | USDT (Base) Before | USDT (Base) After | DAI (Arbitrum) Before | DAI (Arbitrum) After |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| User        | 10,201.0          | 10,201.0          | 10,000.0            | 10,000.0           |
| Resolver    | 9,792.13          | 9,792.13          | 10,000.0            | 10,000.0           |

**Note:** No balance changes occurred because no resolver filled the auction during the test period.

## Issues Identified

1. **Resolver Integration Gap**
   - Standard resolvers are monitoring their own auction contracts
   - Gasless resolvers need proper integration with the relayer API
   - No resolvers are currently filling relayer-posted auctions

2. **Missing Components**
   - Escrow factory contracts not deployed on test networks
   - HTLC secret reveal mechanism not implemented
   - Settlement orchestration needs completion

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Deploy RelayerEscrowFactory contracts on both chains
   - Update resolver services to monitor relayer API
   - Implement proper escrow creation flow

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add resolver profitability calculations with real price feeds
   - Implement comprehensive logging for all transactions
   - Add monitoring dashboard for auction status

## Conclusion

The core infrastructure is operational with successful:
- Gasless auction creation via signatures
- Relayer service posting auctions on-chain
- Multiple resolver services running

However, the complete end-to-end flow requires:
- Resolver integration with relayer API
- Escrow factory deployment
- Settlement orchestration implementation

The system demonstrates the viability of gasless cross-chain swaps but needs the final integration pieces to enable actual token transfers.
