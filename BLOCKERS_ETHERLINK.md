## Issue 1: Missing Dependencies in cross-chain-swap Library

**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Status**: Blocked

### Description
The `cross-chain-swap` library is missing its nested dependencies, specifically:
- `limit-order-protocol` 
- `limit-order-settlement`

This prevents the contracts from compiling.

### Error
```
Error: failed to resolve file: ".../limit-order-protocol/contracts/interfaces/IOrderMixin.sol": No such file or directory
```

### Attempted Solutions
1. `git submodule update --init --recursive` - No effect
2. `forge install` in subdirectories - Directory structure issue

### Workaround
The test suite has been implemented with a simplified `SimpleEscrow` contract that demonstrates the HTLC flow without relying on the complex 1inch cross-chain-swap library. This allows testing of the cross-chain logic while the dependency issue is resolved.

### Next Steps
1. Manually clone the missing dependencies into the correct directories
2. Or use the simplified escrow contracts for initial testing
3. Contact the team about the git submodule configuration

## Test Suite Status

Despite the dependency issue, the following have been successfully implemented:

1. **Foundry Configuration**: Added Etherlink testnet configuration
2. **Deployment Script**: `DeployEtherlinkBase.s.sol` ready for deployment
3. **Test Suite**: `EtherlinkBaseHTLC.t.sol` with:
   - Full HTLC flow test
   - Timeout scenarios
   - Edge case testing
   - Gas comparison

The tests use a simplified escrow contract that implements the core HTLC functionality without external dependencies.
